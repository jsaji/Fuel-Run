# Fuel Run

Fuel Run is a game designed for Primary School children, to aid with their multiplication skills in mathematics. This was originally a project I did in highschool in 2016, and figured it was time that it was given some updates & bug fixes.

## Game Premise

Fuel Run is all about flying a plane to collect 'fuel' and continue flying for as long as possible. But you can't just collect any old bit of fuel - you have to get the one that matches the times table question at the top of the screen. Collecting the right fuel gives you points, and with enough points, a place on the leaderboard.
You have a set number of lives, and you lose one when you choose the wrong fuel or if you don't choose one at all. The more fuel you collect, the faster you fly and the faster you have to collect the fuel (and do times tables).

## Controls

**ESCAPE** to pause the game during gameplay.

**LEFT MOUSE BUTTON** to interact with onscreen buttons. Hovering over buttons with the mouse cursor will cause buttons to change colour.

Use **ARROW KEYS** to move the plane:
* **UP & DOWN ARROW KEY** to move the plane up & down (vertical).
* **LEFT & RIGHT ARROW KEY** to move the plane left & right (horizontal).

Players can move diagonally by holding down one of the keys that allow vertical movement and one of the keys that allow horizontal movement (e.g. holding UP and LEFT will cause players to move left diagonally upwards).
Hold down keys to move in that direction continuously.

## Version History

### v1.0.1 (3 May 2020)

* Bug fixes, including:
    * Refined buttons, so no more accidentally clicking through multiple screens.
    * Music changes based on whether playing or choosing difficulty.
* Performance improvements (lowered framerate, much cleaner code and less simultaneous processes).
* Easier to control the plane with ease, instead of accidentally flying off the screen.

### v1.0.0 (5 September 2016)

* 3 difficulties:
    * **EASY** consists of the times tables from 1 to 6, and is suited for children in lower grades. This is the level that builds upon the times tables of the smaller numbers, and prepares them for the MEDIUM difficulty. In EASY, players have 5 lives and, for every correct answer, they gain 10 points to their score. Fuel box speed increases by 1% every time a correct answer is chosen.
    * **MEDIUM** consists of the times tables from 1 to 12, and is the standard difficulty for children above Fourth grade. It is much more difficult than EASY, helping to form the foundations for more advanced times tables. In MEDIUM, players have 4 lives and, for every correct answer, they gain 15 points to their score. Fuel box speed increases by 2% every time a correct answer is chosen.
    * **HARD** consists of the times tables from 1 to 16, and is designed to be a challenge for those who attempt the difficulty. This level is mainly for those who feel confident in their 1 to 12 times tables and want to go that extra step further. In HARD, players have 3 lives and, for every correct answer, they gain 20 points to their score. Fuel box speed increases by 3% every time a correct answer is chosen.
* Random plane colour on start-up.
* Music and sfx.
* Cool clouds in the background.
* Single player.
* Highscore for each 'session'.
